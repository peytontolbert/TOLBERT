## TOLBERT docs index

This is a fast orientation map for the TOLBERT docs.

### Pick your path

- **If you’re training TOLBERT** (building your own model or continuing pretraining): start with [`tree_of_life.md`](tree_of_life.md), then read [`training.md`](training.md).
- **If you’re just using a pretrained TOLBERT model** (for retrieval, QA, or agents): read [`usage.md`](usage.md) and, if you want more context, skim [`overview.md`](overview.md).
- **If you’re looking for the Python API surface**: see [`api_reference.md`](api_reference.md), which is **aspirational / planned** and will be updated once the `tolbert` package is implemented.

### 3-step quickstart

1. **Build or ingest your Tree-of-Life** (derive it from your RepoGraph / PaperGraph) → [`tree_of_life.md`](tree_of_life.md).
2. **Run TOLBERT pretraining** on the resulting Tree-of-Life–annotated spans → [`training.md`](training.md).
3. **Use the pretrained model for retrieval and agents** (plug TOLBERT into your retrieval / agent stack) → [`usage.md`](usage.md).
